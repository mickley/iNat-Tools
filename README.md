Provided are some of the tools that I have developed to display data from the iNaturalist API:

# Tools for ID-A-Thons

## ID-A-Thon Progress Bar
[id-progress.html](id-progress.html)
This tool shows a configurable progress bar of the number of identifications for an ID-A-Thon event

# iNatJS Javascript Wrapper Library
Hosted as a separate repository, [iNatJS](https://github.com/mickley/iNatJS), provides a flexible wrapper for interfacing with the iNaturalist API, and underpins the tools above.
